                            In one example embodiment, a wagering game system includes at least one wagering game computer program operative on the wagering game platform to detect a wager. A persistent state manager software component is operative to read or write persistent state data to and from the wagering game computer program and persistent state media. In one embodiment, the persistent state media is a bar-coded ticket, and in another embodiment an electronic data storage device such as a RFID device. A messaging system allows persistent state media devices to interact with the wagering game.

Each EWID carried by a player has an associated unique identification code, linked to the respective player&#x27;s account. Players indicate an amount to be wagered by touching the EWID to designated wager amount areas, then place the wager by touching the EWID to a designated wagering area. Because each EWID is uniquely associable with distinct player accounts, the gaming system can support any number of players placing wagers. The funds remain safe in the player account and no funds are stored on the EWID. Only the identification code is detected, which is compared with the associated player account before allowing that player to place wagers.

                            A wagering game system and its operations are described herein. In some embodiments, the operations can include presenting a wagering game on a display device of a wagering game machine. The operations can also include detecting head movements and facial gestures of a player of the wagering game via a video capture device of the wagering game machine, and generating player input data based on the head movements and facial gestures of the player. The operations can further include modifying wagering game content based on the player input data associated with the head movements and facial gestures of the player, and presenting results of the wagering game on the display device of the wagering game machine.

                            A wagering game system and its operations are described herein. In embodiments, the operations can determine a wagering game in progress for a wagering game session, and determine an electronic playing card that is in use for the wagering game that uses playing cards. The operations can also determine primary content related to the wagering game, and electronically present the primary content on the electronic playing card for use in the wagering game. The primary content can include playing elements (e.g., card ranks and card suits) for the wagering game. The operations can also determine secondary content to be presented on the electronic playing card, and electronically present the secondary content on the electronic playing card during the wagering game session. The secondary content can include wagering games that are different from the primary content (e.g., secondary wagering games that use playing elements other than cards, such as slot games).

                            Electronic paper (e-paper) can be incorporated onto player tracking cards (101) to allow logos, themes, and/or other content (e.g., text, images, etc.) displayed on player tracking cards to be updated. An identifier is determined based on data read from a magnetic strip on a rewritable display card (503). The rewriteable display card comprises electronic paper (103). Account information associated with the identifier is received (505). Content to be displayed on the electronic paper is determined based, at least in part, on the account information (507). The content is written to the electronic paper (513).

                            Gaming-related displays present text and graphics viewable with a special visual aid, e.g., a camera phone. The visual aid provides an interface allowing the player to interact with, and be engaged by, the gaming machine and the gaming environment. The text and graphics shown on the visual aid may provide information that adds to the player&#x27;s experience. For example, a gaming system includes a gaming terminal for a wagering game. The gaming terminal includes a light-emitting area emitting a predetermined pattern of invisible light having wavelengths outside the visible electromagnetic spectrum. The gaming system also includes a visual aid including a sensor and a visual aid display. The visual aid detects, with the sensor, the pattern of invisible light, converts the pattern of invisible light into a pattern of visible light having wavelengths inside the visible electromagnetic spectrum, and displays the pattern of visible light on the visual aid display.
